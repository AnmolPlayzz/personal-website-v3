# personal-website-v3
The v3 of my personal website. 

I plan to build it with some 3d elements. 
This is supposed to be my most flagship project.

## The stack
The stack is pretty much set to be Next.JS. If I do end up using 3D, Three.JS will also be included.

## Current status: Early R&D
I'm lookinfg through libraries and tools I would need and iterating on some designs. 

Suggestions are always welcome! DM me on Discord if you have any (@iam.anmol)
